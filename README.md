# GlazeWM Config
My personal configuration for GlazeWM Tiling Window Manager for Windows 11. Feel free to copy or tweek to your liking. Pairs with my Zebar config which can be found here: https://github.com/bdgcypher/zebar-evergarden
## Dependencies
I use the GlazeWM Auto-Tiler found at https://github.com/aka-phrankie/GlazeWM_AutoTile. This requires the user to install pythonw.exe (can be installed with pip if you already have python installed) as well as websockets

```
pip install pythonw
pip install websockets
```
Then you will need to customize the paths in the startup_commands found in the GlazeWM config.yaml file to point to the location of pythonw.exe on your system.
